Perfect squares are non-negative integers which are the product of some integer multiplied by itself. For example, $0 = 0^2$, $1 = 1^2$, $4 = 2^2$, $9 = 3^2$, $16 = 4^2$, etc. Thus, $0, 1, 4, 9, 16, \ldots$ are perfect squares.

Note that no negative integer can be the product of an integer multiplied by itself (a negative integer, when squared, results in a positive value). Thus, negative integers cannot be perfect squares.

In this problem, you must complete the implementation of a method that takes a `long` input parameter, and returns the `boolean` value `true` if the value of the parameter is a perfect square, and `false` otherwise. This implementation must also handle negative values correctly.
